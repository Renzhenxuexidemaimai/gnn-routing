# env parameters
env: ddr-softmin-v0  # for iterative use 'ddr-iterative-v0'
memory_length: 1 # length of history of DMs input to the network as an observation

# policy parameters
policy: gnn  # different choices: 'mlp', 'iter', 'lstm'
gnn_iterations: 2  # number of iterations of message-passing for gnn to perform
hyperparameters:  # json file containing PPO2 hyperparameters to override defaults
graphs:  # empty uses a small-ish test graph. otherwise names match those in the topologyzoo data folder
  - Abilene
vf_arch: graph  # value function architecture (don't use with mlp policy). different choices: 'mlp', 'shared', 'shared_iter'. non-mlp choices currently broken
timesteps: 10000

# DM sequence parameters
sequence_type: cyclical  # type of cycle to use
demand_seeds:  # list of seeds for generating DM sequences
  - 2
cycle_length: 1  # length of cycle that repeats in DM sequence
sparsity: 0.0
sequence_length: 11

# miscellaneous
seed: 1  # overall seed - is broken I think
parallelism: 4

# parameters for tensorboard log and model saving
tensorboard_log: tensorboard
model_name: gnn
log_name: gnn
model_path: gnn.zip

# how many steps to replay (use sequence length - 1, but multiply by number of edges for iterative)
replay_steps: 100
