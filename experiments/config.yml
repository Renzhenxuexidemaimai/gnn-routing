env: ddr-softmin-v0  # for iterative use 'ddr-iterative-v0'
softmin_gamma: 2  # value of gamma to use for softmin routing

# policy parameters
policy: gnn  # different choices: 'mlp', 'iter'
hyperparameters:  # json file containing PPO2 hyperparameters to override defaults
graph:  # empty uses a small-ish test graph. otherwise names match those in the topologyzoo data folder
vf_arch: graph  # value function architecture (don't use with mlp policy). different choices: 'mlp', 'shared'
lstm: false  # whether to place an lstm on the front of the policy network

seed: 1  # overall seed - is broken
parallelism: 4

# parameters for tensorboard log and model saving
model_name: gnn
